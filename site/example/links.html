            Links pretty much what makes the web what it is. In this lecture,
             we're going to take a look at different types of links and how 
             you could create them in your HTML page. So the first type of 
             links that we're going to take a look at are internal links. 
             Here I am looking at the file called links-internal.html, and 
             it's located in the examples/Lecture09 folder. And here we have 
             a couple of links we're going to take a look at. Now the way 
             you create links is by specifying an a element with an attribute
              href. And href stands for hypertext reference. The value of 
              href can either be a relative or an absolute URL. In our case 
              here, since we're discussing internal links which are links 
              that point to internal web pages of the where application, 
              the links we're showing are all relative URL links. However 
              we could still have an even absolute URL links as long as 
              they point, again, to the same web application that we're 
              in. Since we're providing no directory information, the 
              browser will assume that same-directory.html is a file that 
              lives in the same directory as links-internal.html. It's 
              also a very good idea to always specify a title attribute 
              for the a tag. The title attribute is used by the screen 
              readers that help the visually impaired people get through
               the web page. The content in between the opening and 
               closing a tags is the content you're going to see in the 
               web page, when it is served and on which you're going to 
               be able to click to go to the href that the a tag is configured 
               with. Note the second example of our a tag. In this example, 
               we're surrounding a div tag with our anchor tag. In other words, 
               this div tag is going to be the content over our link on which 
               were going to be able to click. Let's go ahead and see what 
               this look like in the browser?
