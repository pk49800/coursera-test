        There are many applications for HTML character entity references, however in this lecture, 
        I will concentrate only on a particular problem that the entity references can solve for us. 
        Since HTML uses certain characters for its syntax, we need a way to differentiate between 
        those characters as HTML and those same characters as content. If we want the browser to 
        interpret special HTML characters as regular content, we need a way to escape them. 
        In other words, we need a way to tell the browser not to interpret them as HTML. Stay&nbsp;in&nbsp;line.
